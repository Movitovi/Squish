# Adjust the player weights

# Target Player
#   When player doesn't pose a great threat
# Target boost
#   When boost is close
# Flee Player
#   When player poses a threat
# Random Position
#   Just pick a random position closer to the top of the map on abyss levels

# Avoid Abyss # This one should only be temporary and not remove an existing target
#   When above the void and vertical velocity is not high in the up direction
#   If so the run towards the nearest block

# Pick one of these targets and maintain for a while
#   Don't pick the same target if recently failed to target

# Jump when about to fall
#   That's walking off a block into the void
#   Falling down on the side of a wall into the void

# Lambda doesn't work with cpus
# Cpus keep falling into the void

# Maybe artificially increase attack rates
# Needs more randomness in target choice






# Test simultaneous deaths
# Test levels with no blocks

# The slider can be selected on page entrance





# If there are many players then the cpu is far too unlikely to choose the non player targets
# Add ability to use abilities
# Don't target teammates

# Reasons are weighted by their distance to the cpu
# reasons to run weights are heavier

# Reasons to run (targets)
#       Unless cpu has kill or invincibility boost with enough health
#           Close player with kill boosts
#           Close player above in position to squish the cpu
#       Might fall in the void

# Reasons to pursue (targets)
#       Player to kill
#       Boost to grab
#       Random spot sometimes when failing too much

# Use phasing to pursue or run when appropriate

# Look for nearest player that hasn't failed to target recently
#       Chance to pick a random spot to go to
#       Chance to pick boosts, favor close boosts
# Head that direction
# Jump walls and holes
# Run from players that have kill ability or are about to squish from above
# Jump or push against a player squishing cpu
# Don't push against if being squish by players on both sides
# Get boosts if nearby

# Add computers
#       Add cpu option in add player page
#       Follow the nearest player horizontally
#       If that player is above self try to jump
#       If at an edge jump
#       If a wall is in the way try to go above or below it if that is safe
#       Don't fall into death
#       Maybe track a player for a while
#       Use randomness within the AI
#       Shield when about to die or to stop vertical momentum
#       Maybe add some sort of path finding
#       Tron cpu support
#       Make cpu ghosts have different AIs that simply wander




# Make more levels
# Upgrade sound
# Go through and remove potentials for mod by zero (specifically the level size being 0)
# Comment the code
# Maybe comment the pages
# Need to organize github
# Make more levels
# Maybe make a user manual

# Don't blit individual blocks every tick

# upgrade sound

# Teams mode
# Ghost mode after death
#       Possibility to revive
#       Only check block collisions

# Add computers
#       Follow the nearest player horizontally
#       If that player is above self try to jump
#       If at an edge jump
#       If a wall is in the way try to go above or below it if that is safe
#       Don't fall into death
#       Maybe track a player for a while
#       Use randomness within the AI
#       Shield when about to die or to stop vertical momentum
#       Maybe add some sort of path finding

# Tron cpu support

# Change vertical squishing to match horizontal squishing
# Player count for default multiple players

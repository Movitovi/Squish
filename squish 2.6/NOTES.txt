# Fixed fps update rectangle size to be correct for tron and other sized levels
# Fixed Game and Watch update rectangle over the last pos
# Made padding slightly larger in update rectangles to (unconfirmed) remove risidual blits during screen wrapping
# Fixed update rectangles for dead arrows, fire, and zaps
# Fixed players stretching wide on the moon level (unconfirmed) by checking size compared to base size in the squish function
# The fps sometimes is captured in a screenshot (may have been resolved)
# Now show the red line above blocks
# Moved level data setup continue/done and back cursor positions
# Now rounds player positions in level editor
# Changed blocks to wrap when appropriate
# Allows editor to click on the wrapped part of a block
# Added bowser
# Added ceiling on levels without vertical looping
# Added pause on entrance into pause or result pages
# Fixed eraser in level editor wrapping when it shouldn't
# Fixed level editor size bugs with eraser and update rectangles
# Fixed issues with invincibility rectangles appearance

# Teams mode
#       Select number of teams in the level select
#       The next page should choose the teams
#       Autofill after all players choose a team
#       Maintain the same teams even after closing the game

# Create 5 lists in a + shape
# The center is no team/team 0
# Left  is 1 red
# Right is 2 blue
# Up    is 3 green
# Down  is 4 purple

# Player pressed direction to select team and this does not affect menu navigation
# Player can affect menu navigation after selecting a team
# Press the shield/ability button to deselect team
# Apply menu navigation pause for controllers

# Give players vertical bands on the side to match their team color
# End game when 1 team is left
# Show that team's color name on the victory screen

# Do this for tron also
# Make tron accents team color


# Not implemented

# Ghost mode after death
#       Only check block collisions

# Add computers
#       Follow the nearest player horizontally
#       If that player is above self try to jump
#       If at an edge jump
#       If a wall is in the way try to go above or below it if that is safe
#       Don't fall into death
#       Maybe track a player for a while
#       Use randomness within the AI
#       Shield when about to die or to stop vertical momentum
#       Maybe add some sort of path finding
#       Tron cpu support

# Upgrade sound
# Go through and remove potentials for mod by zero (specifically the level size being 0)
# Comment the code
# Maybe comment the pages
# Maybe reasign controllers to players without remapping everybody
# Need to organize github
# Make more levels
# Maybe make a user manual
